### Hi there 👋

I'm a freshly graduated software developer with a passion for tech and music.
I studied at the University of Victoria as well as an international exhchange at the University of Hong Kong 🏙

- 👨🏻‍💻 In my spare time I’ve been building [Statify](https://github.com/terahn/statify), a React web app that visualizes your musical taste using a graph of your favourite artists. You can check out a live demo [here](https://statifyforspotify.herokuapp.com/) 😄

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/terahn/) 🤝
